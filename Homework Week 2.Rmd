install.packages("nycflights13")

library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)

```

### 5.2.4

```{}

Find all flights that: 

# 1) Had an arrival delay of 2 or more hours

long_delay <- filter(flights, arr_delay >= 2)

# 2) Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

houston <- filter(flights, dest == "IAH"| dest == "HOU")

3) How many flights have a missing departure time? 

x <- filter(flights, is.na(flights$dep_time))

```

### 5.3.1

```{}

# 1) How could you use arrange() to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use is.na()).

arrange(flights, 

# 2) Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.

arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))

# 3) Sort flights to find the fastest (highest speed) flights.

arrange(flights, desc(distance/air_time))

# 4) Which flights travelled the farthest? Which travelled the shortest?

arrange(flights, desc(distance))

arrange(flights, distance)
